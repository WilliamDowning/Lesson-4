# This project followed the teachings of Jeremy Howard within the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course. 

I wanted to document my process of following along and recreating such results based on the environment and IDE of my choice.
What is within this this repository is just the notebook I conducted my work and the csv file that was a result from my work

I worked with Visual Studio Code that was running the WSL : Ubuntu Window
I made use of Dev Containers to make this possible as well as any other necessary extensions for VS code alone to allow me to operate within the IDE
As far as what libraries and dependencies I utuilized, my environment consisted of a miniforge, conda, and mamba to create my python environment. This is what allowed me to fully achieve running a model within my local desktop.
